I would always have Advil or Tylenol with me because I had such frequent headaches. After receiving treatment my headaches disappeared for good and it was hard for me to believe that it was the power of the adjustment. Even pain killers wouldn’t get rid of my headaches but through Dr. Parks’s adjustment my headache is gone for good. Thank you so much Dr. Park~~~^^"

        "text": "Firstly, Dr. Park’s treatment has truly turned my life around. I am a young woman, 23 years of age, and I had been suffering from severe, chronic headaches, neck aches and back aches every single day for two full years. Each day was literally a battle for me and I was in so much constant pain that it started to affect my work, relationships, social life and just my spirit in general. Absolutely debilitating. I had seen several different \"medical\" doctors and even met with a headache specialist. I was told that there were no significant remarks or findings in regards to my MRIs and CT scans of my brain and back. They couldn’t find anything and could not help me locate the source of my severe pain. I was put on muscle relaxers, steroids, strong pain killers…nothing worked. I still suffered every single day of my life.\n\nMy father advised me to go see Dr. Park and get a consultation with her. That same week I went in to see her. I actually had a spinal tap scheduled. The doctors, at this point, wanted to draw fluid from my brain since they could not figure out what was wrong with me. As you know, there are many risks involved with this procedure and I was honestly scared out of my mind but was also willing to go through with it at that point…hoping they would find something.\n\nAnyhow, it was when I met with Dr. Park and she reviewed my xrays that I found out that the trauma from a car accident I was involved in a few years back was what was causing all of my pain and anguish. She carefully explained to me how my body (namely my pelvis, back and neck) were misaligned and that this was causing my head to hurt. Although I have to admit that I was skeptical at that point, since I had already been to so many different doctors, I knew I needed to give this a shot since I had not sought chiropractic treatment for my issues prior to seeing Dr. Park. So I went ahead and started treatment with her, twice a week. Within a couple of weeks, I already felt my head get lighter and the headaches dissipate. After about 3 months, my back and neck pain were almost gone as well. It has been a year since I started treatment and I am very happy to say that I am PAIN FREE! Dr. Park and the Palmer Upper Cervical method truly gave me my life back."

        "text": "No period came back to normal by upper cervical adjustment! I am a 22-year old, young female. Since I started my period when I was 5th grade, I had never had a period on regular cycle. I had my period in two months or in six months. As I grew up, my irregular period increasingly raised the concern to me and my family. Finally, my mom took me to see a gynecologist for checkup. The doctor told me that my hormones are imbalanced and prescribed me birth control pills. I took it every day and my period came back. It seemed to work then I stopped taking pills. Once I stopped my period pills, my period went back to no cycle again. I also suffered from side effects of birth control pills such as massive acnes on my face. I had more acne even after I stopped taking pills. Thereafter, I had not had my period for a year. While I was seeking safe and effective methods, I heard of very good reputation about Dr. Park’s upper cervical technique and I decided to give it a try in July, 2011. Dr. Park explained how important upper cervical (C1, C2) is, where all the nervous system pass through. She said the nervous system is connected to all of my body and it controls everything in my body. She even told me my imbalanced hormonal system is affected by malfunctioned nervous system which has pressure on by misaligned upper cervical vertebrae. I heard Dr. Park is the only upper cervical doctor who can use HIO technique made by Dr. B. J. Palmer. She adjusted on my upper cervical by hand only. She did not use any other modalities or any other drug. It seemed interesting to me, but at first I doubted the how effective it would be. I went to see Dr. Park twice a week and for a while, I did not feel any changes in my body. However, I was so surprised when I had my period came BACK after about 2months. It was so amazing to me and my family that I started my period again without pills but only by upper cervical adjustment! Since then, I have period on a regular cycle and am very healthy with no acnes on my face! Upper cervical chiropractic really works!"

I will and have already recommended her to my peers. I was in so much pain when I first came to the office. My neck and back were in a lot of pain and I had terrible migraines.

I have tried so many different treatment, so many doctors and I was getting worst and worst. In my first appointment with Dr Park I cried so much pain I was, but when I left I was feeling out of my body, for first time in 10 years I did NOT feel any pain, I came from pain 7-9 to zero instantly. I was driving back home and I could see all the lines and the cars beside me, I could see my shoulder for first time, I can look up and down and no pain. I need to thank my mother in law for introducing me to Dr Park. Please listen to me, don’t w your time, if you have pain go and see Dr Park and I’m sure you will love her. I’m getting better and better, hope soon my problem will be gone. Thank you so much Dr Park!" },

She mentioned that it was torticollis, a condition in which the head becomes persistently turned to one side, often associated with painful muscle spasms. I was experiencing extreme pain around my neck and my head was turning toward right. So I decided to visit Dr. Park and after x-rays and exams, she diagnosed me with torticollis. I’ve been seeing Dr. Park for 3 months now and my neck pain has significantly disappeared and my head position has gotten much better. I am very hopefully that Dr. Park will fix me to close to normal as possible. Thank you, Dr. Park, for your expertise and great technique." },

    "intro": "Everyone has been in pain once. But of those people, there are patients and families who have to carry the enormous pain of living with illnesses.",
    "q1": "Why am I in so much pain? Why am I getting sick?",
    "a1": "Regarding \"Why?\", modern medicine is unable to provide a precise answer and simply puts the focus on treating the symptoms. However, there is surely bound to be a cause of pain and sickness. That exact cause is the \"block of nerve flow\" in the upper cervical vertebrae.",
    "innate": "The human body has infinite vitality; basically everyone is born with \"Innate Intelligence\". The human body is a super computer which modern medicine is no match in imitating. Our body was not made to survive by us consciously manipulating it. Without us paying attention to it, our body \"automatically\" controls our heartbeat, adrenaline levels, blood pressure, digestion of our food and more. This is vitality and all people are born with it.",
    "quote": "However, this ability is inhibited when pressure is put on the nerves that pass through the upper cervical vertebrae and the flow of signals isn’t smooth, therefore leading to many illnesses.",
    "philosophy": {
      "title": "The Philosophy of Chiropractic",
      "p1": "Chiropractic is a healing method with a profound philosophy of restoring the body’s \"Innate Intelligence\" using only the hands for the procedure (Chiro= hand, practic= practice). Basically, it is the coming together of philosophy, science, and art.",
      "p2": "Unlike modern medicine that solely pursues the treatment of symptoms, chiropractic is a practice that focuses on treating the main cause of many diseases, SUBLUXATION, and letting the body work on recovering and restoring its natural ability to recuperate."

      "p2": "This doctor has studied under the last remaining pupil of the legendary Dr. B.J. Palmer (1881-1961), the late Dr. Clarence Jensen. Dr. Park treats the nerve adjustment as her mission, spreading her knowledge and making it her goal to guard the health of the community."

      "title": "The Key to Healthiness",
      "p1": "The difference between healthy and unhealthy people is found in the upper cervical vertebrae. With a slight dislocation, people may not recognize the pressure being put on the nerve until they get sick, which may even lead to disastrous results.",
      "p2": "The most important factor is prevention. Instead of trying to treat pain and sickness when it has progressed, it would be best to look out for your health while you’re still healthy. This is why everyone from children to the elderly should get their upper cervical vertebrae checked regularly."
