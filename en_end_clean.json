        "p1": "The aftereffect symptoms of a car accident normally show 1~2 days, or even a few months after the accident. In fact, the absence of pain doesn’t necessarily mean there is no damage. Many of the symptoms caused by a car accident or trauma lay dormant until later.",
        "p2": "If nerves are put under pressure after the accident, it will not only result in pain, but it will lead to more severe illness. Car accidents can cause damage in many parts of the body such as 7 possible locations in the upper cervical vertebrae and 32 joints and muscles throughout the body."
